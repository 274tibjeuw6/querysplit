# Something About the Source Code
* The source code of our implementation is modified from PostgreSQL source code. Hence, most C files we provide have the same name file in PostgreSQL source code. We just modify some part of them to fit our implementation.
* The C files that are totally written by us are query_split.c, query_split.h for the implementation of dynamic query optimization "query split";
