This branch is created for the future update about Non-SPJ extension. The source code will be uploaded about the middle of February.
However, we actually do not recommand to use this extension because it is not stable and we may continue to update. If SPJ version is enough for your purpose, please use the SPJ version.
Sorry for the inconvience.
